# Public goods game
This repository contains a modlue code for a public goods game (PGG) between cooperator and defectors (optional: loners). The PGG is either played with other randomely picked players from the set of all players (bucketModel) or when players are spatially aranged on a grid with players from their 3x3 neighborhood (latticeModel). Players can update their strategy using a probabilistic revision protocol by looking at a random player in the bucket or in the neighborhood, respectively.
